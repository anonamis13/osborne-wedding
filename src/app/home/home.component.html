  <p class="p-story">
    Trevor and Kate first met in 2011 when their families were part of group from church that went on a spring break cruise together.
    After being paired up for a swing dance lesson on the cruise and spending the week together, they quickly became friends.
    It wasn’t long after that when things started to turn into more than just friends. They continued to date throughout
    high school and as Trevor moved to Columbus to begin college at Ohio State in 2013. A year later, Kate joined him and
    the next 3 years were filled with late night studying, Buckeye football games, growing together in their faith, and falling
    more in love. On September 30, 2017, Trevor popped the question at a swing dance lesson [don’t worry, they’ve gotten
    a lot better since that first lesson on the cruise] and Kate said yes! On November 17, they’ll say “I do” and couldn’t
    be more excited to have family and friends like you to celebrate and be a part of their story!
